# UI Options
option(USE_SCALEFORM "Use In-Complete Proprietary Flash UI with blob ( Not Recommended )" OFF)
# There is also a 3rd option, which is nothing. Nothing will enable base VGUI UI which is also incomplete.

# DEDICATED Server
option(DEDICATED "Build as DEDICATED server. This is Separate from the main build and they are not in-tree compatible.
Make sure to build with -DDEDICATED=0 once you want a regular client again." OFF)

# Physics Options
option(USE_KISAK_PHYSICS "Use the Open Source Physics Re-Build made for kisak-strike from various leaked sources" ON)
option(USE_BULLET_PHYSICS "Use Open Source Bullet3 Physics Engine(zlib)" OFF)
option(USE_BULLET_PHYSICS_THREADED "Use Multi-Threading for the Bullet Physics Engine. Use convar 'bt_threadcount' to set." OFF)
# 3rd option is to have both of these OFF, the closed source blob from Valve will be used instead.




# Kisak-Strike Developer Options

option(USE_ASAN "Enable the Address Sanitizer GCC plugin, used for finding memory errors/bugs" OFF)
option(USE_TRACY "Enable Tracy Profiler support" OFF)
option(TRACY_STORE_LOGS "Turn off Tracy's On-Demand mode. With this flag the profiler will store logs and send them later when the UI connects. Consumes RAM quickly! Mainly useful for profiling the application startup." OFF)
